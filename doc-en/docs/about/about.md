## An introduction to contributing to the EcclesiaCRM project.

The project welcomes, and depends on, contributions from developers and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of ways. A few examples are:

* Code patches via pull requests
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

##First Steps

1. Read this whole page "top to bottom."
2. Introduce yourself in the developer chat at [Tchat](https://gitter.im/ecclesiacrm/Lobby)
3. Take a look at the Open Issues page. We've made it easy for beginners with the Good First Bug Label.
   These are issues that should be relatively easy to fix.
4. Have fun!


## Testing A Branch

As long as there is software, there is a need for software testers. We're no different. Even though we have many automated tests, there's still a very real need for actual human beings to test new features, bug fixes, and other aspects of the software.

Setting Up A Testing Machine

There are three system requirements for a testing machine:

1. Oracle Virtual Box
   * Oracle VirtualBox allows you to run virtual machines on your system for free.
2. wmware
   * wmware is a profesional tool.
3. Hyper-V
   * Hyper-V is now a role in Windows 10 and allow you to virtualise a Linux web server.
     
## Testing EcclesiaCRM

1. Check out the branch you're going to test. You can use the GitHub Desktop Client, manually download the source from the GitHub Page, or click one of the following links:
   * Most often, we'll want help testing the Development Branch
   * Sometimes we'll need to test something in the Expiremental Branch
2. If you downloaded a Zip file, please extract that ZIP to a directory
3. From a command line, navigate to the directory containing the files
4. Wait for the prompt that says EcclesiaCRM is now Hosted
5. Test the features in question
6. Report any issues


## Reporting an issue?

When reporting an issue, please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and EcclesiaCRM version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please add a screenshot; and if you get an error please include the the full error and traceback.
