##How do I run EcclesiaCRM?

Running EcclesiaCRM is not complicated if you have experience with Web applications. If you don't, there are a few things to get used to. It is important to understand is that EcclesiaCRM is a Web-based application, which means it has two distinct sides:

The "server", on which the application actually runs. This is a centrally located computer that stores the files and information that EcclesiaCRM needs to run

The "client", through which a user interacts with the application via a Web browser.

There is only one server, but there can be an unlimited number of clients.

##Installation

EcclesiaCRM is a PHP/MySQL application which runs on a web server, providing web pages so users can update and access the data in the database. You can run both the server and the browser on a single computer, but the real power of a web database application is visible when you have multiple users accessing the database from their own computers.

##Getting started

The application is based on the concepts of people who are members of families and are also members of common interest groups.

After you have installed the EcclesiaCRM application and can login, you are ready to configure the application.

The first thing to do is enter your church name, address, phone and email address into the Report Settings.

EcclesiaCRM will display “My Church” in large, bold letters at the top of each page.
