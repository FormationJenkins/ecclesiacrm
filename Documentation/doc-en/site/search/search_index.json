The name of the menu item: `plgn_mb_plugin_Display_name to ``Settings'' for example the url `plgn_mb_url ``to for example 'v2/meeting/dashboard the icon `plgn_bm_icon at 'fas fa-cogs Then a security option `plgn_bm_grp_sec`` to the possible values of roles defined in the crm, for example 'usr_admin' usr_AddRecords, usr_EditRecords, usr_DeleteRecords, usr_ShowCart, usr_ShowMap, usr_EDrive, usr_MenuOptions, usr_ManageGroups, usr_ManageCalendarResources, usr_HtmlSourceEditor, usr_Finance, usr_Notes, usr_EditSelf, usr_Canvasser, usr_Admin, usr_showMenuQuery, usr_CanSendEmail, usr_ExportCSV, usr_CreateDirectory, usr_ExportSundaySchoolPDF, usr_ExportSundaySchoolCSV, usr_MainDashboard, usr_SeePrivacyData, usr_MailChimp, usr_GDRP_DPO, usr_PastoralCare Here is a complete example -- insert the menu item -- the first one is the main menu !!!
